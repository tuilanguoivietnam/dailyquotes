Backend (FastAPI) quick start
1. Create a Python virtualenv
- python -m venv .venv
- source .venv/bin/activate
2. Install dependencies
- pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
3. Configure environment
- Copy backend/.env.example to backend/.env
- Set DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY in backend/.env
- Optional: set OPENAI_API_KEY and TTS_PROVIDER
4. Run migrations
- cd backend
- alembic upgrade head
5. Start development server
- uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Typical backend structure
- backend/app/main.py â€” FastAPI app and route mounts.
- backend/app/api â€” versioned route modules.
- backend/app/core â€” config and settings modules.
- backend/app/models â€” SQLAlchemy models.
- backend/app/schemas â€” Pydantic schemas.
- backend/app/services â€” business logic (TTS, AI, content).
- backend/app/scripts â€” management scripts.

Backend run script (release asset)
When you download a release asset for the backend, the package contains a run.sh or run.bat script. Execute that script to start the service. The script handles virtualenv creation, dependency install, and service startup. Example:
- ./run.sh start

Local dev (Flutter apps)
1. Install Flutter SDK and set up platforms.
2. Install dependencies
- cd client/flutter
- flutter pub get
3. Run on device
- flutter run -d <deviceId>
4. Build release
- flutter build apk --release
- flutter build ios --release
- flutter build macos --release

Client structure
- client/flutter/lib â€” app sources.
- client/flutter/assets â€” fonts and bundled audio.
- client/flutter/l10n â€” localized strings.
- client/flutter/ios and android â€” native configs.

API reference (core endpoints)
Base path: /api/v1

Auth
- POST /auth/login â€” login with email or username. Returns JWT.
- POST /auth/register â€” create account.
- POST /auth/refresh â€” refresh token.

Content
- GET /content/daily â€” get today's curated items.
  - params: type (mindfulness|bible|sutra|stories|facts)
  - returns: list of content items with id, title, body, tags, lang, audio_url
- GET /content/{id} â€” get content by id with translations and assets.
- GET /content/search â€” query content by keyword, tag, language.
- POST /content/{id}/save â€” save a content item to user collection.
- GET /users/{user_id}/collection â€” list saved items.

TTS and audio
- POST /tts/generate â€” send text and voice params, returns audio URL or id.
  - body: {text, voice, speed, format}
- GET /audio/{id} â€” stream cached audio.

Admin
- POST /admin/content â€” create content (supports translations).
- PUT /admin/content/{id} â€” update content item.
- GET /admin/analytics â€” basic usage metrics.

Schema example (content item)
- id: uuid
- type: string
- title: string
- body: string
- lang: string
- tags: [string]
- published_at: datetime
- audio_url: string | null
- translations: [{lang, title, body}]

API auth
Use Authorization: Bearer <token> for protected endpoints. Admin endpoints require an admin role claim in the JWT.

AI, TTS and content pipelines

AI-driven content
- Use cases: generate personalized affirmations, expand a short quote into a short story, or suggest follow-up reflection questions.
- Integration points:
  - Server-side content generation: editors can request drafted content in the admin UI.
  - On-demand generation in client apps: the client asks the backend for a short tailor-made affirmation for the user.
- Prompts and safety:
  - Keep prompts concise.
  - Validate outputs and run a lightweight filter for profanity and harmful content.
- Example prompt for an affirmation:
  - "Create a 1-sentence affirmation for patience for a user who feels rushed at work."

TTS
- Engine options:
  - Cloud providers: Google Cloud TTS, Microsoft Azure TTS, Amazon Polly.
  - Local fallback: espeak-ng with high quality voice pack.
- Generation flow:
  - Client requests audio by calling POST /tts/generate with text and voice settings.
  - Backend checks cache for the same hash.
  - If cached, return URL. Otherwise request the TTS provider, cache the audio file, and return URL.
- Audio formats: mp3 and ogg for web, m4a for iOS where desired.
- Playback: clients stream audio and prefetch next track when user navigates.

Caching strategy
- Key = sha256(text + voice + speed + format + lang).
- Store audio assets in object storage (S3 or local disk).
- Keep metadata in DB with TTL for stale removal.

Theming and i18n

Themes
- Themes: light, dark, and high contrast.
- Theme switching persists to local settings and syncs to backend when logged in.
- Use platform default unless user chooses otherwise.
- Design tokens control color, spacing, and font sizes.

Localization (i18n)
- Strings use ARB or JSON localization files in client/flutter/l10n.
- Backend content stores translations per content item.
- Locale detection:
  - Client uses device locale by default.
  - Users can switch languages manually in settings.
- Plural and formatting:
  - Use intl package for pluralization and date/time formatting.

Data model and offline sync

Local storage
- Clients store a local cache in SQLite or Hive.
- Cache keys for content and audio metadata.
- Content prefetch for the next N days.

Sync strategy
- Sync runs on app start and when network returns.
- Use incremental sync with last_synced_at timestamps.
- Conflicts:
  - User collections use last-write-wins for simple cases.
  - For edits made offline to user notes, use merge prompts at sync.

Encryption
- Sensitive data such as tokens store in secure storage.
- Local backups stay encrypted with device key.

White noise and bedtime features

White noise
- Built-in white noise tracks: ocean, rain, forest, fan, pink noise.
- Streaming and loop control.
- Timer to fade out audio after N minutes.
- Mix TTS audio with white noise using a low-pass or volume ducking so the voice remains clear.

Bedtime Stories
- Stories come in short formats (2â€“8 minutes).
- Option to auto-read via TTS.
- Choose voice and reading speed.
- Combine with white noise and set a fade timer.

User experience tips
- Keep card content short; avoid long paragraphs for bite-sized consumption.
- Let users queue multiple items for a bedtime session.
- Provide "sleep mode" that dims animation and reduces CPU use.

Privacy and data handling

Data collected
- Minimal personal data: email, preferences, collection items.
- Optional analytics keyed to anonymous ids.

Sync and backups
- User data sync uses secure connections (HTTPS).
- Backup exports available as JSON for user collections.

Third-party services
- Providers: OpenAI, Google Cloud, Azure, or local models.
- Allow admins to choose provider via backend config.

Testing and CI

Backend tests
- Unit tests for services and API endpoints using pytest.
- Integration tests with test database (SQLite) for CI.

Client tests
- Widget tests for Flutter components.
- Integration tests for flows: onboarding, save item, TTS playback.

CI pipeline

FAQ

Q: Where can I download official builds?
A: Visit the releases page for official builds and release notes:
https://github.com/tuilanguoivietnam/dailyquotes/releases
Download the asset that matches your platform. If you download a backend bundle, extract the archive and execute the run script that the bundle includes.

Q: How do I enable TTS with a cloud provider?
A: Set your TTS_PROVIDER and provider credentials in backend/.env. Restart backend. Use POST /tts/generate to request audio. The backend caches audio and returns a URL.

Q: Can I run this offline?
A: Yes. Clients cache content locally. You can use the app without network for saved items and cached audio. Full sync requires network.

Q: How do I add a new language?
A: Add locale files in client/flutter/l10n and update translations for content in the backend. Admin UI supports adding translations per content item.

Q: Can I use my own OpenAI key?
A: Yes. Set OPENAI_API_KEY in backend/.env and restart the backend. The system can use OpenAI to generate content where allowed.

Code of conduct
- Be respectful.
- Use issue and PR templates.
- Keep discussion constructive.
